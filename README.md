# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for two players to play against each other.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Players can take turns placing their symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 game board.
- Automatic win/tie detection: The game checks for winning conditions after each move and displays the outcome (win, tie, or ongoing game).
- Restart option: Players can restart the game at any time to play again.
- Random player start: The game randomly selects which player starts each new game.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. This application requires Python 3 and the Tkinter library.

   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```
4. Run the game:
   - In the terminal or command prompt, enter the following command to start the game:

     ```bash
     python tic_tac_toe.py
     ```

5.  The game window will appear. You can use the mouse to click on the start button and start playing.

   - The game window will display a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe game board.
   - Two players will take turns playing the game. The first player is randomly selected at the beginning of each new game.
   - To make a move, click on an empty square on the game board. The player's symbol (X or O) will be placed in that square.
   - After each move, the game will check for winning conditions. If a player has won, a message will be displayed indicating the winner.
   - If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game will end in a tie.
   - To restart the game, click the "Restart" button. The game board will be cleared, and a new game will begin with a random player starting.
   - You can close the game window at any time to exit the game.

Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!
